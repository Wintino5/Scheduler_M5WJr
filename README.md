# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this project we created a workday scheduler. The styling was done with CSS and the functionality was coded with JavaScript. This challenge allowed us to become more familiar with JQuery and JavaScript. I learned how JQuery can be used to not only simplify our JS code, but also be used to add the currrent date to the browser.
